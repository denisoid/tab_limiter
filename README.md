# Tab Limiter Chrome Extension

Limit the number of open tabs per domain and keep your browser tidy.

Tab Limiter is a simple Chrome extension that helps you manage your browsing by limiting how many tabs you can open for specific websites. If you try to exceed the limit, the extra tab is automatically closed and you’ll get a notification.

## Key features

### Custom domain rules
Add or remove domains and set a maximum number of allowed open tabs for each one.

### Accurate domain matching
Rules match the exact domain and its subdomains (e.g. `example.com` also applies to `docs.example.com`).

### Automatic tab management
When the limit is exceeded, the newly opened tab is closed automatically to keep your workspace clean.

### Notifications
Get notified when a tab is closed because the maximum allowed number of tabs was reached.

### Optional “tabs left” badge (disabled by default)
Optionally show a badge on the extension icon indicating how many tabs you can still open for the currently active website.
You can enable or disable this in the Options page, and the setting is synced via Chrome Sync.

## How to use

1. [Install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-limiter/ahifadmfdpgnjkchbmoafedinacdfomc)
