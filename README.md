# Tab Limiter Chrome Extension

Limit the number of open tabs globally and per domain to keep your browser tidy.

Tab Limiter is a simple Chrome extension that helps you manage your browsing by limiting how many tabs you can have open — either across all sites or for specific domains. When a limit is exceeded, the extra tab is either blocked or the oldest one is automatically closed.

## Key features

### Global tab limit
Set a maximum number of tabs allowed across all sites at once.

### Custom domain rules
Add domains and set a maximum number of allowed open tabs for each one independently.

### Accurate domain matching
Rules match the exact domain and its subdomains (e.g. `example.com` also applies to `docs.example.com`).

### Two behaviors when limit is reached
Choose what happens when a limit is exceeded: **block** the new tab (with a notification), or automatically **close the oldest** tab to make room for the new one. Set the global default and optionally override it per domain.

### Optional badge (disabled by default)
Optionally show a badge on the extension icon with the number of tabs you can still open for the currently active domain. Can be enabled in Options.

## How to use

2. Click the extension icon to open the Options page.
3. Optionally set a **global tab limit** to cap the total number of open tabs.
4. Choose the **global behavior** when a limit is reached: block the new tab or close the oldest one.
5. Add a domain (e.g. `example.com`) and set the maximum number of allowed tabs. Optionally override the behavior per domain.
6. Browse normally — Tab Limiter will enforce your limits automatically.
